function [dia_start, dia_peak] = check_pulse(ppg_section, peak_loc)
    
    % INPUT:
    %   ppg_section -> section of the ppg signal that (should) contain exactly one pulse 
    %   peak_loc -> location of the systolic peak in the provided ppg_section
    %   dia_start -> location of the starting point of the diastolic slope
    % OUTPUT:
    %   dia_peak -> (-1) if no diastolic slope can be found or if certain other criteria is met
    %     -> (otherwise) index of the diastolic slope (its middle point)
